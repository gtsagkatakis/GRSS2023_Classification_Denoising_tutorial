# UCMerced classification & denoising tutorial

This material was prepared for the IEEE GRSS-USC MHI 2023 Remote Sensing Summer School, in conjunction with the 2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

Remote Sensing image Classification and Denoising: A Practical Guide

This repository contains a hands-on, easy-to-follow tutorial that provides an introduction to using Deep Learning techniques for Remote Sensing Image Classification and Denoising. 

The code explores various deep learning architectures, from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to U-NETs and demonstrates how these can be applied to the two tasks in RGB images from the UCMerced dataset.
